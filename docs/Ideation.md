## **1\. Problem Definition**

● Problem Statement:

Smallholder farmers in  Ghana, specifically the northern part and at large sub-Saharan Africa face productivity losses due to lack of timely, localized climate intelligence, crop disease diagnosis, and personalized agronomic support. Current platforms offer fragmented or overly technical solutions, often not accessible in local languages or without smartphones.

● Context and Background:

Agriculture remains the primary livelihood for millions in Africa, yet climate variability, pest outbreaks, and limited extension services severely threaten food security and income. Farmers lack access to real-time weather alerts, predictive disease tools, and localized expert advice. Traditional systems are not scalable, user-friendly, or adapted to local needs and languages.

● Scope of the Problem:

We focus on integrating AI-driven, accessible, and multilingual tools into a unified platform for:

* Localized climate-smart farming advice

* Real-time crop disease detection and alerts

* Text and voice interaction in local languages

## **2\. Proposed Solution**

● Description of the Solution:

We propose TriAgro AI, an AI-powered digital assistant for farmers that combines real-time weather and disease forecasting with NLP-driven multilingual chat support. The platform will be mobile-friendly (web and SMS/USSD compatible) to ensure accessibility across devices.

● Key Features and Functionalities:

* NLP Chatbot (Text & Voice): Farmers can ask questions like “Should I plant maize this week in Tamale?” in English or local languages.

* Image-Based Disease Detection: Upload or capture plant images for AI-driven diagnosis.

* Predictive Pest & Disease Alerts: Alerts based on regional outbreaks and climatic patterns.

* Personalized Crop Calendar: Tailored advice based on farm location, soil type, and season.

* Multilingual Support: Twi, Ewe and English using NLP translation tools.

* Offline Mode: Via SMS/USSD for farmers without smartphones.

● Innovation and Uniqueness:

* Combines weather intelligence \+ disease detection \+ NLP chatbot in a single platform

* Local language support for inclusive access

● Technical Feasibility:

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

* Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB

* AI Models:  (for image recognition and predictions)

* NLP Tools

* Data Sources: Copernicus, Ministry of Agriculture and Ghana Meteorological Agency and Open AI

## **3\. Target Audience and Impact**

● Target Audience:

* Smallholder farmers in Ghana and broader sub-Saharan Africa

* Agricultural extension officers

* Agritech service providers

● Potential Impact:

* Up to 40% reduction in crop loss from pests and disease due to early detection

* Improved planting and harvesting decisions with climate-smart insights

* Increased income stability for farmers

* Empowerment through access to local-language, AI-powered agricultural support

## **4\. Team**

* Larko Djabatey– Backend Developer/Project manager (Node.js, MongoDB, API Integration)

* Stephen Amankwah – Frontend Developer (UX/UI, Web App)

* Albert Nartey – Software Engineer (NLP Specialist, Chatbot and multilingual features)

## **5\. Next Steps and Resources**

● Preliminary Plan:

1. Finalize problem scope and user stories

2. Build core chatbot and frontend UI

3. Integrate AI models for disease detection

4. Connect to weather APIs

5. Test multilingual capabilities and offline mode (SMS/USSD)

● Potential Resources Needed:

* Access to crop image datasets

* Weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeather, Ghana Meteorological data)

* Language datasets for Twi, Ewe, Ga, Dagbane 

* Farmer feedback for early testing
